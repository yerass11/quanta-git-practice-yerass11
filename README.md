# Quanta Git Practice - `<username>`

## Overview

Welcome to the **Quanta Git Practice** repository! This repository is designed to help you master Git workflows using the **GitFlow** methodology. By completing the tasks outlined below, you'll gain hands-on experience with essential Git operations, branch management, and best practices for maintaining a clean and organized Git history.

## GitFlow Methodology

This practice follows the **GitFlow** workflow, which emphasizes the use of specific branch types to manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes. The primary branches used in this workflow include:

- **`main`**: The stable production-ready branch.
- **`develop`**: The integration branch for features.
- **`feature/*`**: Branches for developing new features.
- **`release/*`**: Branches preparing for a new production release.
- **`hotfix/*`**: Branches for quick fixes in production.
